## What is Docker 😄

> - Docker is a set of platform as a service products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers. Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels. All containers are run by a single operating-system kernel and are thus more lightweight than virtual machines. Containers are created from images that specify their precise contents. Images are often created by combining and modifying standard images downloaded from public repositories.

## Why do you need docker 🤔

> - to solve the compatibility issue between different operating systems and different versions of the same operating system and different environments and different versions of the same environment
>
> - Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.

## What can it do for you 🤷‍♂️

> - with docker you can run each service in a separate container with its own dependancies and libraries ,and each container will have its own IP address and port number. This means that you can run multiple instances of the same service on the same server without any conflicts. This is a huge advantage over running multiple instances of the same service on the same server using virtual machines.

## What are Containers 📦

> - container is completely isolated environment for running applications and each container has its own process space, network interface, and filesystem. Containers are lightweight because they don’t need the extra load of a hypervisor, but they all share the os kernel. This means they require less memory than virtual machines (VMs). Containers are also more portable and efficient. You can build images locally, store them in a private registry, and deploy them to any infrastructure that supports Docker containers.
>
> - A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

## Container vs Image 📸

> - An image is a read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. A container is a runnable instance of an image. You can create, start, stop, move, or delete a container using the Docker API or CLI. You can commit your container’s changes into a new image using the Docker commit command. You can push and pull images from Docker registries.

## Create Docker image 📦

### Dockerfile 📄

- Docker file is a text written in a specific format that docker can understand and use it to build an image

- evert thing in the left in capital letters is a command or an instruction each instruction makes docker perform a specific task

- A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using docker build users can create an automated build that executes several command-line instructions in succession.

- when you were buiding an image you were actually running a series of commands that were written in the docker file

- while building the image if any failure happens the image will not be created but docker will cache the previous steps/layers until the failure step and will not run the steps after the failure step

- when the faulure step is fixed and the image is built again docker will not run the steps that were already run before the failure step and will use the cached layers and run the failed step then the steps after the failure

## NetWorks in Docker 🕸️

- Docker networks are the virtual networks that are used to connect the containers together

- Docker networks are isolated from each other and they are not connected to the host network

- Docker networks are created using the docker network command
  > ```
  >    docker network create 'network name'
  > ```
- Docker networks can be created in 3 different modes

  > - Bridge: the default mode
  > - Host : the host network
  > - None : no network

- Docker networks can be connected to each other using the docker network connect command

  > ```
  >    docker network connect 'network name' 'container name'
  > ```

- Docker networks can be disconnected from each other using the docker network disconnect command

  > ```
  >    docker network disconnect 'network name' 'container name'
  > ```

- Docker networks can be removed using the docker network rm command

  > ```
  >    docker network rm 'network name'
  > ```

- Docker networks can be listed using the docker network ls command

  > ```
  >    docker network ls
  > ```

- Docker networks can be inspected using the docker network inspect command

  > ```
  >    docker network inspect 'network name'
  > ```

## Docker vs Kubernetes 🐳 vs 🕸️

each operating system consists of OS Kernel and a set of applications and libraries that are used to run the operating system

the os kernel is the core of the operating system and it is responsible for managing the hardware resources and the applications and libraries that are used to run the operating system
